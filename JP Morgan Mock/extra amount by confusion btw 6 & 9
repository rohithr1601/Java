The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains N (actual remaining amount).
 

Output

For each test case, output the maximum possible extra amount in newline.

 

Constraints

 

   •   1 ≤ T ≤ 102

   •   1 ≤ N≤ 10000001
