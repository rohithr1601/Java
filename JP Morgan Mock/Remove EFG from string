An event management company has come up with a unique idea of printing their event tickets. Based on the ticket number combination (str1), the visitor is directed towards a particular class of audience. The task is to

create a program/application to fetch the ticket number based on the following conditions:

Any occurrences of digits EF and G should be deleted. The characters EF should be in the same format.

Input format

The candidate has to write the code to accept 1 input(s). First Input -Accept value for str1 which is a string consisting of numbers and uppercase alphabets without any spaces

Output format

The output should be a string without any spaces (Check the output in Example 1 and Example 2) Additional messages in output will cause the failure of test cases.

Constraints

Str ((A,Z),(0-9))

No spaces and special characters allowed.

Only uppercase alphabets in the input string

Example 1:

 Input:

 4523EF58G  

 Output :

 452358 



Example 2:

 Input:

 E12F35G58 

 Output :

 E12F3558

Explanation:

In the above example, characters E and F are not together So, they won't be deleted. The output will be with only character G removed.
