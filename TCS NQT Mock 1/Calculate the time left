QUESTION 02
bookmark_border
The person is travelling from place A to place B. He will take 12 hours to reach the destination by roads. As the person starts his journey, he has to note the current time in hours H and minutes M ( non negative integer input ).The task is to find the time left for him to reach the destination (output).If current time (hours or minutes) is a value exceeding 24 hours, the output should be a negative integer value, representing total exceeded hours and minutes (See the Example 3).

Input format

The candidate has to write the code to accept two inputs separated by a new line.

First Input Accept value for hours which is H.

Second Input- Accept value for minutes which is M.

Output format

The output should be time in 24 hour format (Check the output in Example 1 and 2 above). The hours and minutes should be separated by "::" without any additional space(See the output in examples). 

Additional messages in output will cause the failure of test cases.

Constraints:

0<H<=100

0<M<=60

Example 1:

Input:

14  -> value of H i.e Hours

20  -> value of M i.e Minutes

Output:

9::40   



Example 2:

Input:

1   -> value of H i.e Hours

15 -> value of M i.e Minutes

Output:

22::45  



Example 3:

Input:

30  -> value of H i.e Hours

5    -> value of M i.e Minutes

Output:

-6::5
