You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and print the maximum profit you can achieve.



Input Format:

First line - n, the size of array

Second line - all the n elements



Output Format:

A single integer representing the maximum profit you can achieve.



Sample Input:

6

7 1 5 3 6 4



Sample Output:

7



Explanation:

Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.

Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
