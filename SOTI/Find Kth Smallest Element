Find Kth Smallest Element



Given an array A and an integer K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.



Input Format :

First line of input will contains two integers N and K - size of the array and given number number k respectively.

The second line contains N space-separated integers, the elements of the array.



Output Format :

Only line of output should contain one integer which is Kth smallest in the given array.



Example 1:

Input:
6 3
7 10 4 3 20 15

Output : 7
Explanation :
3rd smallest element in the given 
array is 7.
Example 2:

Input:
5 4
7 10 4 20 15

Output : 15
Explanation :
4th smallest element in the given 
array is 15.




Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^5

1 <= A[i] <= 10^5

1 <= K <= N
