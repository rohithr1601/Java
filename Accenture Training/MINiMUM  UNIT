MINiMUM  UNIT 
 Tom runs a juice shop where he has two machines,M and N, for making juice.M is a big machines
 which can make juice for 100 customers is one go,while machine N can make juice for only 4 customers at a time.
 
 M consumers X units of power,while N consumers Y units of power. your task is to find and return
 an Integer value representing the MINiMUM number of units of power toms machines will consume to serve P customeers
 to serve P customers.He can run any combination of M and N.
 
 EXAMPLE 1:
 105
 80
 10
 
 OUTPUT : 100
 Example 2:
 input1:105
 input2:80
 input3:10
 
 
OUTPUT : 100
